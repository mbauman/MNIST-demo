# Classifies MNIST digits with a convolutional network.
# Writes out saved model to the file "mnist_conv.bson".
# Demonstrates basic model construction, training, saving,
# conditional early-exit, and learning rate scheduling.
#
# This model, while simple, should hit around 99% test
# accuracy after training for approximately 20 epochs.
